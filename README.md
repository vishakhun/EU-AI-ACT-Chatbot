# Chat with EU AI ACT - Mistral7B and Llamaindex

## Overview
This Project showcases the integration of advanced AI models for document processing and information retrieval, focusing on the EU AI Act dataset. It leverages the capabilities of Llama CPP and Langchain Embeddings for text processing, llama-index for data indexing, and transformers for accessing pre-trained language models.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Text Processing**: Integration of Llama CPP and Langchain Embeddings for deep semantic analysis and natural language processing.
- **Data Indexing and Retrieval**: Efficient handling of document data with llama-index.
- **Access to Pre-Trained Models**: Utilization of Transformers and Sentence-Transformers for leveraging state-of-the-art language models.
- **Effective Logging and System Operations**: Implemented using standard Python utilities.

## Tools and Libraries
- Llama CPP and Langchain Embeddings
- llama-index
- Transformers and Sentence-Transformers
- Python Utilities (logging, sys)

## Installation
To set up the project, install the necessary Python packages as listed in the project. Ensure you have a Python environment ready for running the notebook.

## Configuration
Follow the instructions within the notebook to configure the logging, set up the Llama CPP and Langchain Embeddings, and initialize the Service Context and Document Indexing.

## Usage
The notebook is designed to be interactive. Run each section sequentially, and use the query engine to process queries related to the EU AI Act.
